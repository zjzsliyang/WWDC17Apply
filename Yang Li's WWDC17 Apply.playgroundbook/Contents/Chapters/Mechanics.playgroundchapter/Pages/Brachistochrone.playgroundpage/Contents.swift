/*:
 After our rocket was launched, let's do something more!
 
 We already known that *The nearest distance between two points is always a straight line*! 
 
 However, have you think about *what is the curve traced out by a point acted on only by gravity in the shortest time*?
 
 This is a famous problem called [Brachistochrone Problem](glossary://Brachistochrone%20Problem) posed by [Johann Bernoulli](glossary://Johann%20Bernoulli) in June 1696.
 
 [Galileo](glossary://Galileo) in 1638 had studied the problem in his famous work(Discourse on two new sciences). He think that the path of quickest descent from A to B would be an arc of a circle.
 
 At the end, five mathematicians responded with solutions via [calculus of variations](glossary://calculus%20of%20variations) or [Snell's law](glossary://Snell's%20law): [Newton](glossary://Newton), Jakob Bernoulli (Johann's brother), [Gottfried Leibniz](glossary://Gottfried%20Leibniz), [Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus](glossary://Ehrenfried%20Walther%20von%20Tschirnhaus) and [Guillaume de l'Hôpital](glossary://Guillaume%20de%20l'Hopital).
 
 What's your idea?
 
 Think about it and experiment now!
 
 You can also draw a path yourself!
